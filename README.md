## Hi, I'm Miriam ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend and distributed systems engineer with a background in classical piano and composition. I fell in love with programming while exploring computer art and music, and that passion led me to work on developer tools (like Firefox Devtools and Replay.io's time-travel debugger) and large-scale distributed systems. 

This fall (2024), I attended the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/about) where I studied the book "Operating Systems in Three Easy Pieces" and explored computer music with Supercollider.

Currently open to interesting conversations & career opportunities!
